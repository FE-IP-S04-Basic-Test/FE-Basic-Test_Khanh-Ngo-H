1. On HTML documents, where can we inject CSS and JS files? The reason why?

=> We can inject CSS files in the tag head of the HTML documents to specify the priority of the stylesheets.
JS files can be injected at the bottom of the body tag to render all of the element needed, therefore we
can select the element in the documents to add interactions.
